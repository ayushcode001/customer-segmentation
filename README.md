# Retail Customer Segmentation — End-to-End ML Pipeline

> **Turn 110K raw e-commerce transactions into four actionable customer personas — from data ingestion to a live, interactive dashboard.**

 **[Live Demo → customer-segmentation-os.streamlit.app](https://customer-segmentation-os.streamlit.app/)**

## Problem Statement

A Brazilian e-commerce marketplace (Olist) has **93,000+ customers** generating **110,000+ transactions** worth **R$ 13.2 million** over two years. The marketing team has no systematic way to:

- Identify their most valuable customers before they churn
- Distinguish one-time buyers with growth potential from genuinely dissatisfied ones
- Allocate limited campaign budgets to the right cohort
- Personalize outreach instead of blasting generic promotions

**Goal:** Build an unsupervised ML system that automatically segments the customer base into distinct, business-interpretable personas — each with a concrete marketing action — and serve it through a real-time prediction interface.

---

## Approach & Methodology

### Data Engineering — Relational Join Pipeline

The raw Olist dataset is split across **9 normalized CSV tables** (customers, orders, items, payments, reviews, products, sellers, geolocation, translations). The pipeline performs a multi-step relational join chain with pre-aggregation to avoid Cartesian explosion:

```
Customers ──┐
             ├── Orders + Payments (agg) + Reviews (latest per order)
Products ───┤
Sellers ────┘
```

### Data Cleaning & Validation

- Filtered to **delivered orders only** (removed cancelled/unavailable)
- Parsed 6 datetime columns, handled missing review scores (median imputation)
- Removed anomalous records (zero/negative payments)
- Extracted temporal features (year, month, day-of-week)

### Feature Engineering — Extended RFM

Classic RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) extended with behavioral signals:

| Feature | Description | Business Signal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Recency** | Days since last purchase | Engagement freshness |
| **Frequency** | Count of unique orders | Purchase habit strength |
| **Monetary** | Total spend (BRL) | Revenue contribution |
| **Avg Review Score** | Mean rating given | Satisfaction level |
| **Avg Installments** | Mean installment usage | Price sensitivity indicator |

### Modeling — K-Means Clustering

- **Log-transformation** on skewed features (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- **StandardScaler** normalization to unit variance
- **K-Means** (k=4) selected via Elbow Method + Silhouette Analysis
- **PCA** (2 components) for 2D visualization projection

### Deployment — Streamlit Cloud

- Models serialized with `joblib` (scaler, K-Means, PCA)
- Interactive dashboard with real-time prediction on user inputs
- GitHub Actions cron job pings app every 5 days to prevent hibernation

## 🎯 Customer Personas Discovered

| Persona | Profile | Recommended Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Champion** | High value, highly satisfied | Add to VIP program — do NOT offer discounts |
| **Satisfied One-Timer** | Good experience, hasn't returned | Send 10% cross-sell discount to build habit |
| **At-Risk Whale** | High spend, fading engagement | Trigger aggressive "We Miss You" campaign |
| **Detractor** | Low satisfaction, unlikely to return | Suppress from ads, trigger service recovery email |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [Olist dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) (place CSVs in `data/raw/`)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayushcode001/customer-segmentation.git
cd customer-segmentation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Full Pipeline (Training)

```bash
python run_pipeline.py
```

This executes: `Ingestion → Merge → Clean → EDA → Feature Engineering → K-Means Training → Model Export`

### Launch the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

### Launch with API Backend (optional)

```bash
python run_app.py
```
